Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Introductory course in electromagnetism or optics (6.630 or 6.631 or equivalent)

Requirements
------------

10 Problem Sets and Term Paper

Collaboration on problem sets is encouraged.

Grading
-------

Grades will be determined by 10 problem sets, which must be turned in, a term paper, and class participation. The formula that will be used to calculate your final grade is:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Problem Sets | 40% |
| Term Paper | 40% |
| Class Participation | 20% 

Course Policy
-------------

### Collaboration

Collaboration on problem sets is permitted. However, you must list who you collaborated with when you hand in your problem sets. Groups may discuss the problems, strategies for solutions, etc. However, each person is expected to do all of the problems independently. You may not copy the problem solutions from other members in your group. Evidence of copying will be considered cheating.

### Plagiarism

Direct copying of text from other sources (books, review articles, etc.) on the term papers will be considered plagiarism. Reproduction of figures or data is permitted provided that the reference is cited.

Required Text
-------------

The [detailed course notes]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/lecture-notes) written by Prof. Kärtner will serve as the required course text.

The complete set of lecture notes is also available as a single file. ([PDF - 9MB]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_977s05_textbook))
